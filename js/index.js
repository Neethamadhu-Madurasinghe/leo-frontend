		description: 'The project "Survival 5.0" was implemented by the Leo Club of University of Colombo for the fifth consecutive year with the aim of raising community awareness and implementing prevention programs to reduce the impact of natural or man-made disasters in Sri Lanka. The phase one was carried out on 8th January 2023 at Kegalle Aranayaka Manadi Primary School. Students and their parents from Manadi Primary School\'s Grades 4 and 5 attended the awareness program, which was followed by a practical training activity program led by officials from the Kegalle District Disaster Management Center.  The second phase was implemented on 3rd of February 2023 at Rathnapura East Mudunkotuwa Vidyalaya. The awareness session on managing floods was conducted by Mr. S.H.M. Manjula, Assistant Director, Disaster Management Center, Rathnapura. While the awareness session was in progress the interlock stones donation was carried out. From this, it is expected to redevelop the damaged area near the school main hall due to flooding and facilitate the entire school community in carrying out their daily operations without any hassle arising from heavy rain and flooding. In conclusion, team Survival 5.0 was very satisfied with what was done in two phases in Rathnapura and Kegalle to help our own community in reducing impacts and overcoming natural disasters. The benefit created for the community is long-lasting since the students or children who participated in the awareness sessions have the strong power of spreading the message of managing disasters to society.

		description: 'Leo Club of University of Colombo organized UOC Leos Get-Together 23’ for the second consecutive time this year. With the aim of promoting unity, team work, fellowship while giving a different experience away from the usual club activities, UOC Leos Get-Together 23’ was held on 5th February 2023 at Ambalama Leisure Lounge, Hanwella. The COVID-19 pandemic and the financial crisis that Sri Lanka is suffering from, have had a profound impact on both physical and mental health, particularly for young people. Speaking of the university students of Sri Lanka, COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant financial crisis in the country affected their education, and the mental. Almost two years of their university life was spent in a remote manner due to the pandemic. The opportunities to engage with their own batch mates, build up new connections with friends and different people, joining physical gatherings and enjoying their university life was limited and it was quite a huge pressure on youth which depreciated their mental health. Especially they lacked the opportunities to build connections with the senior and the junior batches in the university.  As a solution, the idea of UOC Leos Get-Together 23’ was brought into success. It was a casual event where club members got the chance to enjoy with fellow members, build new connections by participating to the fun and leisure activities which were arranged. UOC Leos Get-Together 23’ was a remarkable event as not only the current club members, but also prospects and past members also participated in the event. Certificate awarding to appreciate the active members of the club in the past leoistic year was a significant part of the day where club members were encouraged to engage more in club activities. This fun filled day was concluded with a DJ party where the club members could end this enjoyable day with their favourite dance moves.'
