The COVID-19 pandemic and the financial crisis that Sri Lanka is suffering from, have had a profound impact on both physical and mental health, particularly for young people. Speaking of the university students of Sri Lanka, COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant financial crisis in the country affected their education, and the mental. Almost two years of their university life was spent in a remote manner due to the pandemic. The opportunities to engage with their own batch mates, build up new connections with friends and different people, joining physical gatherings and enjoying their university life was limited and it was quite a huge pressure on youth which depreciated their mental health. Especially they lacked the opportunities to build connections with the senior and the junior batches in the university.  As a solution, the idea of UOC Leos Get-Together 23’ was brought into success. It was a casual event where club members got the chance to enjoy with fellow members, build new connections by participating to the fun and leisure activities which were arranged. UOC Leos Get-Together 23’ was a remarkable event as not only the current club members, but also prospects and past members also participated in the event. Certificate awarding to appreciate the active members of the club in the past leoistic year was a significant part of the day where club members were encouraged to engage more in club activities.

It's a testament to our collective commitment to nurturing nature and striving together for a better tomorrow. This initiative encompasses various phases, each aimed at instilling a sense of environmental responsibility and inspiring action for positive change.
		In the first phase, we focused on raising awareness among young children. At Beruwala St. Lazarus Preschool, we engaged 24 students in tailored nature-based activities on February 16th, 2024. These activities not only taught the children about plants and the environment but also fostered a sense of stewardship, encouraging them to see themselves as caretakers of our planet from an early age.
		Moving on to the second phase, we undertook a mangrove plantation program on March 6, 2024, around the banks of the Hikkaduwa Water Treatment Plant. Mangroves, with their robust roots, play a crucial role in protecting coastal communities from erosion and storms. Moreover, they provide vital habitats for wildlife, support biodiversity, and help combat climate change by trapping carbon dioxide. By planting mangroves, we aimed to bolster coastal resilience, promote biodiversity, and contribute to a more sustainable future for both local communities and the planet.
		The third phase involved organizing a plant donation program at Sri Poorwarama Maha Viharaya in Horana on March 19, 2024. This initiative empowered individuals and communities to engage in environmental stewardship by providing them with resources for greening efforts. By supplying plants and organic fertilizers, we not only enhanced the visual appeal of neighborhoods but also supported biodiversity, enhanced air quality, and promoted environmentally friendly agricultural practices. 
		On the same day, we marked the end of our project by launching an e-magazine and Facebook page dedicated to nature content. These platforms serve as vital tools for fostering environmental awareness and appreciation. Through curated articles, poems, and photographs, they educate individuals about the significance of nature and inspire action for its protection. By sharing personal experiences and visuals, we aim to cultivate a sense of community and responsibility, mobilizing individuals towards positive environmental action.
		As our project journey comes to a close, we reflect on the profound impact of our collective efforts. From planting seeds of hope in young hearts to fostering environmental stewardship through community engagement, each endeavor has made a lasting impression on our shared landscape. As we bid farewell to this chapter, we carry forward the lessons learned and the connections forged, knowing that our commitment to nurturing our planet and fostering sustainability will continue to bear fruit long into the future. Through sharing our story and the impact of Plant a Hope 6.0, we hope to inspire others to plant their own seeds of hope for a greener, healthier tomorrow.`

The project was done at Sri Sumangala Balika Maha Vidyalaya, Panadura.  The initiative aims to make a lasting impact on the school, the country, and finally the world. Students, parents, and the school's Environmental Pioneer Brigade contributed us to complete the project, providing manpower and fostering a lifelong commitment to environmental conservation. The project is an ongoing journey, inviting everyone to participate, whether planting their first or hundredth tree. By planting trees, we are not only planting trees but also cultivating a future where humanity and nature coexist in harmony.`

The event, held at the university premises, saw enthusiastic participation from students and faculty alike, with more than 50 ticket books sold as part of the fundraiser. The primary objective of this event was to raise funds for the Leo Club Fund, which supports various community service projects and initiatives undertaken by the club. The raffle provided a fun and engaging way to involve the university community in a worthy cause while fostering a spirit of camaraderie among participants. The excitement in the room was palpable as three winners were chosen from the pool of entries. The winners, who were thrilled to be part of this historic event, received their prizes from the Executive Board  of the association, adding to the overall atmosphere of celebration. Kalani, the Secretary of the club, presented the first prize to Denethi . The second prize was awarded by Isuru, the Vice President, recognizing another outstanding member. The highlight of the day came when Dihini won the grand prize for her remarkable contributions. The prize was presented by Damith, the President of the club, in a moment of celebration and pride. The event was a memorable occasion, showcasing the club’s appreciation for its dedicated members. The event highlighted the Leo Club commitment to innovation in fundraising and its ongoing efforts to support charitable endeavors. By organizing such creative initiatives, the club not only raises essential funds but also strengthens bonds within the university community, paving the way for future success. The ‘Big Winner’ raffle was more than just an event; it was full of joy, surprises, and life-changing moments for the winners.

		description: `Leo Club of University of Colombo organised a street music event for people with busy lifestyles. The event, known as ‘Street Beats’, wasn’t just about going somewhere and singing songs. It was organised to raise funds for an upcoming project called ‘Diyani’ by the UOC Leo Club.
		On the evening of 14th September 2024, our members and music team arrived at Galle Face with musical instruments. There were many kids, elders, and young people enjoying themselves. After selecting the best spot, we began our ‘Street Beats’ event. As our music team performed, people were drawn to this special and unexpected event. They enjoyed the songs we sang, and we could feel their appreciation through their feedback. We also sang songs that most people knew, so they sang along with us. 
		It was a wonderful experience for both us and the people. We performed several times in different spots around Galle Face, and we successfully achieved our main goal of fundraising for the ‘Diyani’ project.`
