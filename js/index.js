The COVID-19 pandemic and the financial crisis that Sri Lanka is suffering from, have had a profound impact on both physical and mental health, particularly for young people. Speaking of the university students of Sri Lanka, COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant financial crisis in the country affected their education, and the mental. Almost two years of their university life was spent in a remote manner due to the pandemic. The opportunities to engage with their own batch mates, build up new connections with friends and different people, joining physical gatherings and enjoying their university life was limited and it was quite a huge pressure on youth which depreciated their mental health. Especially they lacked the opportunities to build connections with the senior and the junior batches in the university.  As a solution, the idea of UOC Leos Get-Together 23’ was brought into success. It was a casual event where club members got the chance to enjoy with fellow members, build new connections by participating to the fun and leisure activities which were arranged. UOC Leos Get-Together 23’ was a remarkable event as not only the current club members, but also prospects and past members also participated in the event. Certificate awarding to appreciate the active members of the club in the past leoistic year was a significant part of the day where club members were encouraged to engage more in club activities.

Appointed Project committee made sudden plans to implement this project successfully and their target was specially focused on children residing in children’s homes. Instead of a conventional children’s day celebration or typical alms giving the focus was on giving those children something more valuable; HOPE. To implement this project, Lawris Children’s Home in Borella was selected to share love and laughter. The day was marked by friendship, games, and heartfelt conversations, where the children were inspired to pursue their dreams through education. The highlight was witnessing their joy as they received gifts and showcased their talents. The event concluded with cherish after generating a positive impact and hope to these young souls. World Children's Day is not about meals and gifts, but also spreading joy and inspiring young minds. `

More than just an entertainment escapade, this event was a thoughtful gesture, featuring a delectable lunch and special badges to recognize the invaluable contributions of our unsung heroes. Understanding the transformative power of collaboration, we sought the support of the Leo Club from the University of Colombo, whose involvement became integral to the success of our initiative.

As our second phase, we planned a food preparation competition for as the second project phase in Ehaliyagoda, Wiyalagoda village in December 2023. Also as our third phase, we decided to make a garden in a town area that doesn't have proper space for gardening. For that, we found an orphanage in Punchi Borella, named Lawris Children's Home, which doesn't have a proper space to make a garden.

Banners with powerful drug prevention messages are displayed. This project aims to address drug prevention comprehensively, combining motivational education and a community-wide awareness effort to create a positive impact in the fight against substance abuse. In our third phase, we focus on the power of creativity and education. We launch an island-wide art competition that involves schools across Sri Lanka, all dedicated to the cause of drug prevention. The winning school of 6–9 grades is A.B. Sasmitha Dulnith Prince of Wales’ College, Moratuwa. Then we conduct an awareness program to empower students with knowledge and motivation. This program aims to educate students about the critical importance of leading a drug-free life, using creativity and art as a medium for empowerment. We conducted this awareness program in association with Moratuwa Police Station and Lunawa Ayurveda Hospital, Lunawa.`

		description: `"Plant a Hope 6.0" is more than just a project; it's a beacon of hope in a world where environmental concerns weigh heavily on our minds. It's a testament to our collective commitment to nurturing nature and striving together for a better tomorrow. This initiative encompasses various phases, each aimed at instilling a sense of environmental responsibility and inspiring action for positive change.
		In the first phase, we focused on raising awareness among young children. At Beruwala St. Lazarus Preschool, we engaged 24 students in tailored nature-based activities on February 16th, 2024. These activities not only taught the children about plants and the environment but also fostered a sense of stewardship, encouraging them to see themselves as caretakers of our planet from an early age.
		Moving on to the second phase, we undertook a mangrove plantation program on March 6, 2024, around the banks of the Hikkaduwa Water Treatment Plant. Mangroves, with their robust roots, play a crucial role in protecting coastal communities from erosion and storms. Moreover, they provide vital habitats for wildlife, support biodiversity, and help combat climate change by trapping carbon dioxide. By planting mangroves, we aimed to bolster coastal resilience, promote biodiversity, and contribute to a more sustainable future for both local communities and the planet.
		The third phase involved organizing a plant donation program at Sri Poorwarama Maha Viharaya in Horana on March 19, 2024. This initiative empowered individuals and communities to engage in environmental stewardship by providing them with resources for greening efforts. By supplying plants and organic fertilizers, we not only enhanced the visual appeal of neighborhoods but also supported biodiversity, enhanced air quality, and promoted environmentally friendly agricultural practices. 
		On the same day, we marked the end of our project by launching an e-magazine and Facebook page dedicated to nature content. These platforms serve as vital tools for fostering environmental awareness and appreciation. Through curated articles, poems, and photographs, they educate individuals about the significance of nature and inspire action for its protection. By sharing personal experiences and visuals, we aim to cultivate a sense of community and responsibility, mobilizing individuals towards positive environmental action.
		As our project journey comes to a close, we reflect on the profound impact of our collective efforts. From planting seeds of hope in young hearts to fostering environmental stewardship through community engagement, each endeavor has made a lasting impression on our shared landscape. As we bid farewell to this chapter, we carry forward the lessons learned and the connections forged, knowing that our commitment to nurturing our planet and fostering sustainability will continue to bear fruit long into the future. Through sharing our story and the impact of Plant a Hope 6.0, we hope to inspire others to plant their own seeds of hope for a greener, healthier tomorrow.`

Executed date- 8th of March from 9.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. at the University of Colombo Premises. We aimed to equip them with essential leadership skills. The program included physical workouts, mental exercises, and team-building tasks to foster collaboration, communication, and problem-solving. The trainers provided valuable insights on leadership principles such as teamwork, communication, decision-making, and emergency preparedness. We presented gifts to outstanding performers. The program's innovative approach established a new standard for youth leadership development. Phase Two program would focus on equipping these individuals to become mentors and leaders within their communities.
		Phase 02: Shaping Our Future Leaders (March 28th, 2024, 8:30 AM - 1:30 PM, S.K.K. Sooriarachchi Secondary School)
	   In Phase 02 of Project Lead C1, the Youth Empowerment and Leadership Training (YELT) program was developed to empower young leaders identified during Phase 01. The YELT program took place at S.K.K. Sooriarachchi Secondary School, targeting the school's prefects. The program is executed from 8.30 am. to 1.30 p.m. The program focused on developing critical leadership skills such as communication, teamwork, and strategic thinking. Activities like "Lined Up and Pass the Message" were used to improve communication and teamwork, the "Circle Game" was used to foster trust building, and games like "RPS War" and "Number Pick" honed strategic thinking and decision-making.
	   So the project Lead C1's two distinct phases not only empowered young people with essential leadership skills but also created a ripple effect. By equipping future leaders within the school community, the project ensures a lasting impact on the student body and contributes to a more capable and engaged youth sector in Sri Lanka.`
